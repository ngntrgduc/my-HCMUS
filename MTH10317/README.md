## Stuff
Some fun stuff I have implemented during this course:
- Basic image processing like sharpen, blurred, noise,...
- Image reconstruction with bit plane
- Use bit plane slicing to know hidden image of steganography image
- Edge detection
- DFT, DCT
- PSNR, SSIM metric
- SVD compression
- Morphology
- Geometric transformation
- Image stitching
