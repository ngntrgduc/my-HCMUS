### Notes
- [Storytelling with Data notes](https://ngntrgduc.github.io/posts/storytelling-with-data/)
- [Dual axis: **bad**](https://blog.datawrapper.de/dualaxis/)
- [Bar plot with long label -> switch to horizotal version](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/hard_label.html)
- [Radar chart: not so good](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/spider.html)
- Pay attention to the bar order. If the bars represent unordered categories, order them by ascending or descending data values.
To visualize several distributions at once, kernel density plots will generally work better than histograms. Also avoid stacked histogram.
- Bars on a linear scale should always start at 0.
- Avoid large filled areas of overly saturated colors. They make it difficult for your reader to carefully inspect your figure. 
- Avoid using different axis scaling in separated pannels of a small multiples plot.
- Whenever possible, design figures that don’t need a legend.
- 3D charts are evil. Don't go 3D.
- The best visualization software is the one that allows you to make the figures you need. 
- When you’re trying to show too much data at once you may end up not showing anything.
